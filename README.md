## 🎯 About Me

I design and deploy scalable machine learning systems in performance-critical environments.

With 3+ years of experience across financial trading infrastructure and industrial IoT domains, I specialize in building ML systems that are:

- ⚡ Low-latency
- 📦 Production-ready
- 🔁 Continuously monitored
- 📊 Integrated into real-world decision workflows

At **Morgan Stanley**, I worked on high-frequency market data validation systems supporting trading and risk operations, optimizing latency-sensitive workflows and strengthening downstream reliability.

At **UBC**, I architected an AWS-based predictive maintenance system processing 51K+ daily IoT sensor events, deploying ensemble models with automated retraining and monitoring pipelines that projected $50K+ monthly operational savings.

I'm particularly interested in roles where machine learning meets engineering — building systems that are not just accurate, but scalable, reliable, and observable.
